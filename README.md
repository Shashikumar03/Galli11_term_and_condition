Galli11

Project Overview

Galli11 is a skill-based mobile fantasy cricket application that allows users to demonstrate their cricket knowledge by creating fantasy teams for local and (temporarily) international cricket tournaments. Users select players based on their skills (e.g., best bowler, batsman, or all-rounder) to compete for wallet-based rewards. The app promotes local cricket players and tournaments by increasing their visibility. Galli11 is not a gambling or betting platform, as outcomes depend on users' strategic decisions and knowledge, not chance.

Note: The feature to create teams for international matches is temporary and will be discontinued in the future. Users will be notified via the app or website when this change occurs.
